      "Well well well. Like a moth to a flame, I end up at Mi Cafe. I just returned to LA after going home for Thanksgiving break, and there is no better way to regain my rhythm than to drink an overpriced, sweet drink.",
      "Today, I ordered their strawberry matcha. I’ve already had their regular matcha cream top and blueberry version, so if I am going to be a repeat offender, I can’t also violate my rules by ordering the same drink.",
      "The strawberry matcha, I am sorry to report, is a massive L to the Austin economy. The matcha creme top + the strawberry jam was SUPER thick. It was too sweet for my liking. Maybe it was because I cleansed myself with a week of home food. I will give myself a month to become delusional, and then the match will be good again!",

      "Kaffee Bohnen is a fixer upper episode turned cafe renovation. They have very jolly decorations and it's just the start of November. The decorations are by far the coolest I have seen out of any cafe. It has a rustic, industrial feel and is super well lit. Everything about this place feels intentionally decorated, and I can really appreciate the details. I’m coming here with Jay; Aishu and Allison may join us but they are late.",
      "There are two large tables with outlets on either end which are easily accessible. The only downside would be if this place gets crowded, then the amount of seating would be limited. I got a hazelnut latte and it's pretty bog standard. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about either. Overall, Olympic ave is unbeaten with the number of great cafes within a walking distance."

      "Mi Cafe has, in my opinion, a really nice vibe because of the second story view over the street. It makes me feel like I am in Asia, sitting in a highrise while enjoying my cheap coffee. Aesthetically, the place could not be more basic; the most notable thing is the abundant outdoor seating. A few outlets are inside, with those being prime seats. Ran into Aishu and Allison today!",
      "The drinks themselves are quite delicious. I would say its up there in terms of my favorite matcha to drink. I got the regular matcha creme top and sipped it without a straw. Not too sweet, not too bitter – just how I like it. The chair looked very uncomfortable, and by no means is it nap worthy, but it was not as bad as I thought it would be."

      "Cafe Mak is one of those places you feel like should be a museum but turned into a cafe after an unsuccessful venture. There are many oil paintings hanging around, and their furniture choice feels purposeful. I can only describe it as Stuart Little’s vision of a quaint cafe.",
      "Getting here was alright; you do have to walk through a sketchier part of Wilshire. They have plenty of seating with outlets, but some of the seats make me feel uncomfortable. It is fleeced couches which is alright, but I am not the biggest fan. I got a matcha latte and a chicken pesto panini. The matcha is the right sweetness for me (dessert matcha), and the sandwich is alright at best. There is no AC; however, they keep fans running at all times which add to the ambiance. It feels like a cool east San Jose cafe."

      "About time is one of my favorites because of how work friendly it is. That is probably the only positive point of this place lol. The drinks are on the sweeter side, basically pure sugar if you get the wrong drink.",
      "I’ve been here quite often, with various memories attached to this place, and most if not all are pleasant. Today I got a Dalgo Latte and it was a regular latte with sugar chunks that dissolved into the drink, progressively making it sweeter. I forgot about my drink for an hour and by the end, it tasted like pure syrup. I would recommend the Tiramisu Einspanner if you wanted a drink here.",
      "Anyways, they have two stories, and their 2nd floor has a bar-like seating with chargers overlooking the first floor. I fw it heavy. They also have great looking dessert, but never got them before."

      "There is a decent amount of seating, but most spots have outlets to charge devices. That is a huge plus considering my laptop’s battery life and 3.33 hour lecture.",
      "I got a sparkling yuzu matcha. I never had it before and will never get it again. The order came out super quick. It tastes exactly like what the name suggests, but I can’t shake the taste of the concoctions Jay, Sophia, Tony, and I made that one night with Yirui’s yuzu jelly. That’s the only reason why the taste rating is lower."
